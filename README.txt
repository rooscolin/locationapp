Made use of open source code found online, this is a modification for our purposes.
The program will get the current location of the user and display that position in coordinates. 
The program will then calculate using haversines formula the distance between surrent location, and Oshawa Ottawa and the cn tower.

== Description ==

The program will assume the location in which you are is represented at a 25km radius circle. If you fall within 25km of any 
location (Ottawa, Oshawa, or the CN Tower) it will display that you are currently at that location. 
This is updated as you press the find my coordinates button and will update all the distance fields.
